# Weather App

## Getting Started

Copy over `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out the api key details.

Install dependencies `npm install`  (or even better `bun install` ðŸ˜‰)

From there `npm run dev` to start the application.

## Whats inside

- Remix.run (of course)
- Tyepscript (absolute must)
- Material Design
- Material Icons
- TailwindCSS (I'm not familiar enough with Materials' own styling solution as of yet, however I used their components where I felt necessary)
- Prisma for a DB to store the favourites
- Session storage for auth
- Weather API to get the weather details.
- remix-validated-form for typesafe form submission and parsing
- zod for parsing the api requests
- @epic-web/remember for it's easy to implement singleton pattern

I would love to talk about a bunch of ideas for optimizations I had, that I didn't have time to implement but given more time there are lots of interesting approaches that could be taken to do so,
